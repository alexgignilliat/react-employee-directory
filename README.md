# React Employee Directory

## Description

This is an employee directory created with React. This was a huge learning experience, and while there are still a few things I'm working out, it's generally how I envisioned it. I went into this not knowing a ton about React, and although I most definitely have a lot more to learn, I believe I now have a solid foundation to build upon.

â€œRemember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the Universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up."  - Stephen Hawking
